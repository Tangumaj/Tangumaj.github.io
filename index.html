      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p>Anti-Asian racism has disturbingly increased in the UK over the last few years, incited by the COVID-19 pandemic and a post-Brexit political environment. Members of the East and Southeast Asian communities, for whom the UK has long been home, have found themselves increasingly targeted through verbal abuse, physical violence, and xenophobic rhetoric. This surge in hate crimes not only reflects a fear of contagion but deeper societal anxieties around national identity, race, and belonging. The rise of anti-Asian hate in the UK does indeed offer a prism through which one could explore how racial boundaries are constructed and maintained, and how global crises sharpen these divisions.</p>
</p>
      <p>The pandemic-fueled rise in anti-Asian racism is neither an isolated incident nor a new phenomenon, but rather the latest expression of entrenched racial othering in the UK. Since Asians have lived in Britain for over a century, they are often constituted as perpetual outsiders in a nation where whiteness is implicitly and intricately linked to belonging. This represents the constant negotiation of racial categories described in the theory of racial formation by scholars such as Michael Omi and Howard Winant. According to Omi and Winant, race is not a fixed biological factor but a social category that undergoes a constant reevaluation in light of events with a political origin or social movements. In this context of the UK, the COVID-19 pandemic and the xenophobic atmosphere in the wake of Brexit have galvanized claims toward a reassertion of racial boundaries with Asians as the "other." </p>
<p>These racial boundaries are underpinned by ideologies of whiteness salient in British society. James Baldwin's essay "On Being White and Other Lies" is critical of the social construction of whiteness as an unmarked and dominant category. It is here that Baldwin's insights are particularly relevant, for they reveal how whiteness in the UK functions as the norm against which all others are measured. Asians, despite generations of constituent contributions to British society, are often not understood as properly British. The pandemic only exacerbated this dynamic insofar as the racial stereotype of Asians as vectors of disease allowed for fears to be projected onto their bodies. Through an ideological process, these principles work to constitute the whiteness of the British and the Asian communities as foreign and threatening, irrespective of citizenship status.</p>
<p>This anti-Asian racism is also not contained within the bounds of the UK nation-state but forms part of a global pattern of racial order. The concept of "transnational whiteness" by Yasemin Arat-Koç provides a useful framework for understanding the exporting and reinforcement of racial ideologies across borders. She further articulates that whiteness is a global signifier of privilege, while non-white populations are often excluded through practices that are reflective of global power relations. In light of this, anti-Asian racism in the UK partakes of and constitutes a broader transnational process through which Asians are perpetually racialized as outsiders, a process on which both global events like the pandemic and national ones like Brexit give renewed emphasis.</p>
<p>This increase in anti-Asian racism in the UK is representative of larger patterns of racial formation - the kind that scholars like Omi and Winant discuss. Of course, a guiding theory here is that race can be and is constructed and negotiated in reaction to changing social and political situations, some of which are quite specific. Brexit has been one of those pivotal moments in which the renegotiation of racial categories has occurred in the UK. In particular, as the country forged for itself a new direction outside the European Union, there definitely was an increase in xenophobic and anti-immigrant sentiment that often targeted people of color, including Asians. This post-Brexit atmosphere was fertile soil for racial anxieties into which the pandemic cast anew the light on diseases and contagion fears that ultimately further othered Asian communities.</p>
<p>Another useful lens through which to understand the racialization of public health comes from Fredrickson's historical analysis in “Racism: A Short History.” Fredrickson traces how longstanding associations of disease have been racialized, with blame for diseases often falling along lines of color. Indeed, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the blame for the virus which spread across the globe often fell upon Asians, in yet another salient illustration of how racial scapegoating occurs in global health crises. In so doing, the threat of contagion fixed racial boundaries through the expression of Asia as a dangerous "other," even as whiteness was renaturalized as standard purity and safety.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the research of Nancy Foner into Afro-Caribbean communities in the UK and the U.S. may be utilized as a background in which to situate the experience of Asians being racialized as outsiders. While Foner focuses on Black immigrants, her insights into the exclusionist practices that limit full participation in British society are often spot-on for Asian populations. Both groups are long-term residents of the UK but continue to face marginalization and exclusion from what it means to be British. This represents an ongoing struggle for belonging since the racial boundary has continued to be drawn in a manner that excludes non-white populations from full membership within British society. Anti-Asian racism on the rise in the UK starkly acts as a reminder that racial boundaries and ideologies of whiteness continue to frame national identity and belonging. While the UK espouses itself as a multicultural society, these events have shown a very different exclusion of the non-white population from full membership. The Brexit and COVID-19 pandemic convergence has exposed the fragility of racial harmony in Britain, where old racial anxieties flare anew during times of crisis. In this way, drawing upon the work of such a wide range of scholars-from Omi and Winant to Fredrickson and Baldwin-one builds an understanding of how race is continuously built upon and resisted, and further still, in what ways white ideologies achieve their end for racial hierarchies both within and outside of the nation-state.</p>
