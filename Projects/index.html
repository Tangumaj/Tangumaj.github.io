      <h3>Human-Computer Interaction Project - Laundro-Map</h3>
      <p>Project group: Julian Tanguma, Leo Moran, Josh Meier, Ezra Barber</p>
      
      <h4>Goal:</h4>
      <p>We would like to solve the issue of chaos in the laundry room, as the laundry room can always be hectic with entire buildings sharing a set amount of washers and dryers. Our project aims to show which laundry machines are available and which are not. It will also show how long until they will be free.</p>
      <p><br></p>

      <p><br></p>
      <p>The prototype addresses key user needs by providing location-based navigation, allowing users to select their dorm and view machine availability with clear indicators. It includes a timer and queue management system to streamline access to machines and prevent conflicts. The reporting feature enables users to notify others about broken machines, while the simple and intuitive interface ensures ease of use. These features align with the feedback from interviews, emphasizing convenience, clarity, and personalization.</p>

      <h3>Final Three Requirements</h3>
      <div class="section">
        <h4>(Top) Users can see how much time is left on each machine in their dorm.</h4>
        <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is a core feature of the website, allowing users to check machine availability remotely. Without it, users would have no way of knowing whether a machine will be free at a certain time, making it harder to plan laundry schedules.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h4>(Middle) Users can see when machines are out of order and/or report a broken machine.</h4>
        <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This feature helps users plan ahead by identifying broken machines, preventing wasted trips to the laundry room.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h4>(Bottom) Users can select a dorm/building preference to display upon login.</h4>
        <p><strong>Justification:</strong> By allowing users to set a default dorm preference, they can quickly access relevant machine availability information.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>How the Prototype Addresses Each Requirement</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>(Top Left) Dorm Preference Selection: Users can set their dorm building as a default, ensuring that when they log in, the laundry dashboard displays their preferred location without extra navigation.</li>
        <li>(Top Right) Out-of-Order Machines: Machines that are broken are clearly labeled in the interface with a distinct visual indicator (e.g., red or grayed-out status). This helps users identify unavailable machines instantly.</li>
        <li>(Bottom Left) Time Remaining on Machines: The prototype includes a live status tracker for each laundry machine, displaying the remaining time in an intuitive interface. Users can quickly see which machines will be available soon.</li>  
      </ul>
      <h3>Analysis Process</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Axial Coding: The team identified common themes in user responses, grouping feedback into categories such as availability tracking, ease of use, and error prevention.</li>
        <li>Affinity Diagramming: A visual mapping of user needs and pain points helped structure key design decisions, ensuring the interface addressed the most pressing usability concerns.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>UX Research Process</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Semi-structured interviews were conducted to understand laundry habits and frustrations.</li>
        <li>Focus groups were held to refine feature priorities.</li>
        <li>Users interacted with prototypes to give immediate feedback about app structure and development.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Interaction Flows</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>(Top Left) Setting Dorm Preferences: Users can set their dorm preference for easy future access. (WIP)</li>
        <li>(Top right) Identifying Out-of-Order Machines: machine indicators that show broken/working machines.</li>
        <li>(Bottom Left) Checking Machine Availability: Users log in and can slick on their building to see which machines are available.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><br></p>
      <p><br></p>

      <h3>Results from UX Evaluation</h3>
      <h4>What Worked Well:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Overall Task Flow:</strong> Users found most tasks “pretty straightforward” and “intuitive,” especially setting a default dorm, which was completed very quickly (about 1 minute as noted in the UX Metrics).</li>
        <li><strong>Default Setting Feature:</strong> Participants appreciated that once they set a default, “it would take you straight into Watson” and eliminate the need to pick a location every time.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Feedback:</strong> The timer and notification features were generally well received, supporting the core function of tracking machine availability.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>What Didn’t Work Well:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Report Button Issues:</strong> Several users were confused by the report button’s design. One participant noted, “there's no back button,” and another mentioned issues with how to select the specific machine for reporting.</li>
        <li><strong>UI Clarity:</strong> The use of gray boxes to group washer and dryer options led to confusion. One interviewee explained, “the fact that they're both grouped in a little gray box” made it hard to distinguish individual elements.</li>
        <li><strong>Metadata Input:</strong> Participants expressed frustration having to manually input machine details. As one said, “I definitely think I was confused… I was just disappointed that I had to pick which dryer was the one that wasn't working for me.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How the Prototype Improved Based on UX Evaluation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>UI Adjustments:</strong> (Top) The design was refined to remove or rework the confusing gray boxes. For example, feedback like, “maybe getting rid of those gray boxes would make it easier” was directly addressed.</li>
        <li><strong>Report Function Redesign:</strong> (Middle) The report feature was updated by repositioning the report button and adding a clear “back” or cancel option. One participant’s exact feedback—“there's no back button”—prompted this change.</li>
        <li><strong>Metadata Automation:</strong> (Bottom) To ease the reporting process, the prototype was improved so that machine details are now auto-associated, reducing the need for manual entry. This change reflects the feedback where a user noted, “I would prefer metadata” to be automatically captured.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>UX Evaluation Tasks</h3>
      <p>The evaluation included the following tasks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Task 1:</strong> Finding a washer/dryer, setting timers, and exploring the interface.</li>
        <li><strong>Task 2:</strong> Reporting a broken machine.</li>
        <li><strong>Task 3:</strong> Setting a default dorm/building preference.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These tasks were chosen to directly test the three core requirements of the prototype (machine timer display, reporting functionality, and default building selection).</p>
      
      <h3>UX Evaluation Process</h3>
      <p><strong>Evaluation Method:</strong> A focus group was conducted with two stakeholders who are college students from Watson and Norse Dorm Halls.</p>
      <p><strong>Process Details:</strong> Participants engaged in a Focus Group session, sharing real-time feedback while completing each task. The session was recorded (with permission), and informal UX metrics were collected via timestamps, observational notes, and tally marks.</p>
      <p><strong>Protocol Reference:</strong> The session followed the structured guidelines as set out in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15wn35OkObiNx5SCXlUI0nWkAc6_i_vLzimEwW41f9w0/edit?tab=t.0" target="_blank">UX Evaluation Protocols document.</a></p>
      
      <h3>Substantiation with Anonymized EXACT Quotes & UX Metrics</h3>
      <p><strong>Exact Quotes from Users:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Pretty straightforward. Everything seemed understandable.” (Interviewee 2, task 1)</li>
        <li>“There's no back button.” (Interviewee 2, reporting task)</li>
        <li>“I definitely think I was confused… I was just disappointed that I had to pick which dryer was the one that wasn't working for me.” (Interviewee 1, reporting task)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Informal UX Metrics Collected:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Time on Task:</strong> Finding machines and setting timers: ~3 minutes; Reporting: ~1:30 minutes; Setting a default: ~1 minute</li>
        <li><strong>Observational Notes:</strong> Frustration with the report button and UI layout inconsistencies were recorded.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Future Steps</h3>
      <p>Based on the evaluation, the following future steps are proposed that go beyond mere prototype refinements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Reporting Feature:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Functional Improvements:</strong> Incorporate an automatic association of machine metadata to eliminate manual input, and add a clear back or cancel button to resolve the “no back button” issue.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>UI Design Overhaul:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Revise the grouping and labeling of washer/dryer options to remove the misleading gray boxes.</li>
            <li>Add an actual floor mapping of the washrooms.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Additional Functionality:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Explore integrating more detailed notifications (e.g., real-time queue information) and potential accessibility enhancements.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>System Requirements Consideration:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Some suggestions (e.g., additional accessibility features or data encryption for sensitive inputs) will require backend system changes beyond the Figma prototype improvements.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
